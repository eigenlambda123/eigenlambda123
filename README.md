<h3 align="left">About Project10X: My Structured Learning Method</h3>

**Project10X** is my personalized, project-driven approach to mastering backend development and foundational math skills through a curated set of real-world projects and problems.

- **Backend Builder Series:**  
  A focused roadmap of ~10 backend projects that cover APIs, authentication, filtering, aggregation, deployment, and testing (planned).
  
- **Linear Algebra Edition:**  
  Learning linear algebra deeply using projects inspired by Gilbert Strangâ€™s textbook. This series emphasizes intuition, proofs, and practical applications to build strong mathematical foundations.

- **Stats Edition:**  
  Structured projects designed to build a solid understanding of fundamental statistical concepts and their practical applications.

- **Calculus Edition:**  
  An intuition-first, project-based study of calculus starting from limits and building upward. This series aims to strengthen my understanding of calculus in a practical context.

This method helps me maintain a balanced weekly schedule, integrating backend development, math, machine learning, and minimal frontend work for testing purposes.
