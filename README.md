  I design and build backend systems from the ground up.  
  My learning path is project-driven—applying math, algorithms, and software design through hands-on experiments.  
  Sometimes I write code. Sometimes I stare at the terminal, waiting for the magic to happen.

### Learning Framework: Project10X

A self-designed, **milestone-driven learning system** based on progressive projects:

- **10 projects per domain**, each building deeper technical mastery  
- Focus on **systems thinking, edge cases, and clean design**  
- Math series (10x Linear Algebra, Stats, Calculus) connected to backend work:  
  simulations, ML pipelines, and API-driven modeling  

---

### Professional Goals

Currently focused on:

- Backend developer internships (remote or PH-based)  
- Technical prototyping roles in early-stage ventures  
- Collaborations in hackathons, data-driven MVPs, or open-source projects
